                wanted to write something meaningful in
                it,
                but in the essence of time, I cut it short.
                Really short. However, it did spark the idea in me of doing something like this more seriously.

                it might be that it did not work,
                and in fact I had to write and change some more things until it worked. I'm saying this just in case
                some actually wants to use this as a tutorial. (do not).

            <p>
                A while ago I started playing around with UE5. I was looking into the Niagara Particle System, and what
                one can do with them. It's super powerful,
                and you can achieve really impressive things technically. I was following specifically the works of
                <a href="http://asher.gg/" target="_blank">Asher Zhu</a>.
            </p>
            <p>It sparked the idea of trying to make a bullet hell. Interparticle collisions, if handled on the GPU, can
                be very fast. I also wanted it to work on mobile.
                And every important bit should be coded in C++, blueprints as little as possible. Just to practice my
                programming skills.
            </p>

                Setup
            </header>
            <p>
                I started following the setup that Epic describes on their
                <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-unreal-engine-projects-for-android-development/"
                    target="_blank">docs</a>.
                Most notably, these steps were undertaken:
                <li>Setup Android SDK and NDK for Unreal</li>
                <li>Setup the phone for development</li>
                <li>Setup the editor for Android</li>
                <li>Configure the editor for mobile graphics</li>
                <li>Test and launching on the device</li>
                <li>Packaging and installing on the device</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's good to note that things didn't go very smooth. For some reason, the phone was being discovered in
                the Android Studio only if the USB was
                connected in certain ports. And at some point, it stopped working all-togheter. I ended up buying a new
                phone, which fixed the problem.
                Not the usual solution, but my old OnePlus3 was being very finicky.

                I wanted my bullet-hell to be space-themed. So I found a free low-poly static mesh on the internet. I
                got that and imported it.
                Later, I would need to switch it for a skeletal mesh, but for the moment, a static one would do.
                Any other graphics were at this point not important, as I just wanted to get the prototype going.

                Code
            </header>
            <p>
                I started playing around with different types of movement. I wasn't sure what was going to work for a
                spaceship, so I tried multiple.
                I started with a character, as it comes with a Movement Component. However, the collider coming with the
                character was an issue. Also,
                the character class is made for humanoids, walking upright, not for cylindrical shapes placed
                horizontally.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up coding my own pawn. I added a collider, setup the input, and I wanted to see it move. This is
                what I came up with. Inside the tick,
                I calculate the new direction vector.
            </p>
            <code>
                FVector directionNormalized = MovementDirection.GetClampedToSize(0, 1);
            </code>

            <p>
                And then I calculate the new location of the actor with this formula.
            </p>
            <code>
                const FVector NewLocation = GetActorForwardVector() * directionNormalized.SizeSquared() * DeltaTime * MovementSpeed;
            </code>
            <p>
                Set the new location and rotation, and voila, a moving actor.
            </p>
            <code>
                AddActorWorldOffset(NewLocation, true, &hitResult);</br>
                SetActorRotation(FMath::Lerp(GetActorRotation(), directionNormalized.Rotation(), 0.05f));
             </code>
            <p>
                The lerp is there to make the rotation smoother.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now onto particles!
            </p>
            <p>I was in for some disappointing news. I was really excited about the possibilities of Niagara particles,
                take advantage of the GPUSim, and just go nuts with the numbers.
                But for particle collisions, the GPUSim is not available. Only the CPUSim. This meant my big plans for
                lots of bullets were dwindled.
            </p>
            <p>However, not all was lost. Niagara, even on CPU, it's pretty fast. And I also just wanted to see the
                project up and running on mobile.</p>
            <p>I setup a particle system and attached it to the ship. I also put down a cyllinder in the map, to test
                the collisions.</p>
            <p>The particle system blueprint setup has lots of small details, which all can be looked up online,
                especially
                <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/getting-started-in-niagara-effects-for-unreal-engine/"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.
                I might go in detail about them later, if I come back to this page, but for now, I'll skip to the last
                juicy part.
            </p>
            <p>To get the collisions working, you need this function in your pawn.</p>
            <code>
    ReceiveParticleData_Implementation(const TArray<FBasicParticleData>& Data, UNiagaraSystem* NiagaraSystem, const FVector& SimulationPositionOffset)
</code>
            <p>Inside, this goes:</p>
            <pre>
<code>for (auto &particle : Data) 
    { 
        const FVector start = particle.Position; 
        const FVector end = particle.Position + particle.Velocity * 0.05f; 
        const float radius = particle.Size * 1.1f; 
        
        TArray<AActor*> ActorToIgnore; 
        ActorToIgnore.Add(this); 
        
        FHitResult HitResult; 
        
        UKismetSystemLibrary::SphereTraceSingle(GetWorld(), start, end, radius, ETraceTypeQuery::TraceTypeQuery1, false, ActorToIgnore, EDrawDebugTrace::None, HitResult, true); 
        
        if (HitResult.HasValidHitObjectHandle()) 
        { 
            auto hitActor = HitResult.HitObjectHandle.FetchActor(); 
            hitActor->TakeDamage(100, FDamageEvent(), GetController(), this); 
        } 
    }</code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                That's the major points of this 1-day test I did. I increased the particle numbers (in the thousands I
                think), and deployed to my mobile. It ran, it worked,
                surprisingly well. Hopefully, I find the time to finish this project soon.
