            <p id="tribute-info">Stephen the Great, also known as Stephen III of Moldavia, was a famous 15th century
                ruler
                of the Principality of Moldavia, a region located in present-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine. He is
                widely
                considered one of the greatest leaders in Romanian history and is remembered for his military victories,
                religious devotion, and cultural achievements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stephen was born in 1457 in the city of Siret, Moldavia. He was the son of Bogdan II, the Prince of
                Moldavia, and was educated in the court of his uncle, Alexander the Good. At the age of 18, he succeeded
                his
                uncle as Prince of Moldavia and quickly established himself as a powerful and ambitious ruler.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of Stephen's main priorities was to defend Moldavia from the constant threat of invasion from the
                Ottoman Empire. He led several successful military campaigns against the Ottomans, earning him the
                nickname
                "Stephen the Great." He also formed alliances with other European powers, such as Poland and Hungary, to
                further strengthen Moldavia's defense.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to his military achievements, Stephen was also known for his religious devotion. He was a
                devout
                Orthodox Christian and built many churches and monasteries throughout Moldavia. He also supported the
                spread
                of Christianity and education in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stephen's reign was also marked by cultural achievements. He patronized the arts and promoted the
                development of literature and music in Moldavia. He also built many castles and palaces, including the
                famous fortress of Neam»õ and the Princely Court of Suceava, which served as the capital of Moldavia
                during
                his reign.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his many accomplishments, Stephen's reign was not without challenges. He faced several internal
                conflicts, including a rebellion led by his own brother, Petru Aron. He also had to contend with the
                constant threat of invasion from the Ottoman Empire and the expansion of neighboring powers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these challenges, Stephen the Great managed to maintain the independence of Moldavia and leave a
                lasting legacy in the region. He died in 1504, but his memory is still celebrated in Romania and Moldova
                to
                this day. He is remembered as a hero who defended his people and his country against invaders and as a
                patron of the arts and culture. His legacy is still visible in the many churches, monasteries, and other
                buildings that he built during his reign.</p>
